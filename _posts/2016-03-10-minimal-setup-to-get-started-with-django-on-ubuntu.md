Installing and setting up Django can get very intimidating if you are just starting out with the framework.

[Django Official Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/) is a very good place to start reading about Django. Make sure you are on the *correct* documentation version.

I also recommend going through [Django Polls](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/) and [Rango](http://www.tangowithdjango.com) to quickly learn the basics of Django. The latter being a bit *outdated*, so a word of caution when following through the tutorial, however most of the things should work with the latest django versions.
